# TGH 5.0 BulkBuy
## The Spark
**How BulkBuy was initialized**

As students, we are aware of the overwhelming amount food, that we are forced to purchase in bulk. Grocery stores like Costco, Walmart, FreshCo etc  stock the products which is way too much as a single student. A report from the CBC found that **396 kilograms of food per capita** is wasted in Canada each year from overload of **groceries** (CBC, 2022).

_This is what created BulkBuy._

BulkBuy came from the growing demand for **convenient** and **cost-effective** grocery shopping solutions. With busy lifestyles and an increasing emphasis on **sustainability**, we wanted to create a platform that allows people to purchase groceries in bulk, reducing packaging waste and **saving both time and money**.

**How we built BulkBuy**

BulkBuy was built using modern web development technologies. We used a combination of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface. For the back end, we utilized a robust server framework and a secure database to handle user accounts, order processing, and inventory management. The delivery logistics are managed through a third-party integration to ensure smooth and timely deliveries.

Figma is a prototyping and design tool, which we used to map out the different screens and functions for our mobile application. 

## The Urge to Break our Laptops
**The challenges we ran into**

Building BulkBuy came with its fair share of challenges. One of the main hurdles was integrating with various suppliers and distributors to source bulk grocery products at competitive prices. Additionally, ensuring accurate inventory management and timely deliveries required meticulous planning and coordination. Another challenge was integrating Redis and Docker. We never used Redis before and had an infinite loop in our Docker build process.
